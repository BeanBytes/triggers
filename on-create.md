name: On Create Event Workflow

on:
  create:
    # This workflow will be triggered when a branch or tag is created.
    # For example:
    # - Creating a new branch: git push origin new-feature-branch
    # - Creating a new tag: git push origin v1.0.0

jobs:
  # Define a job named 'log-creation-event'
  log-creation-event:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest # Specify the runner environment

    steps:
      # Step 1: Checkout the repository code
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        # This action checks out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE,
        # so your workflow can access it.

      # Step 2: Log the created ref
      - name: Log created ref
        run: |
          echo "A new ref was created!"
          echo "Ref Type: ${{ github.event.ref_type }}" # branch or tag
          echo "Ref Name: ${{ github.event.ref }}"     # The name of the branch or tag
          echo "Pusher: ${{ github.event.pusher.name }}" # The user who pushed the ref
          echo "Repository: ${{ github.repository }}"    # The repository name (owner/repo)
          echo "SHA: ${{ github.sha }}"                  # The commit SHA associated with the ref
        # This step uses the 'run' keyword to execute shell commands.
        # It accesses GitHub context variables (github.event, github.repository, github.sha)
        # to get information about the event that triggered the workflow.
```

- `github.event` is a context object in GitHub Actions that contains the full webhook payload of the event that triggered the workflow run.

In the context of the `on: create` event, `github.event` will contain information specific to the creation of a branch or tag. For example:
- `github.event.ref_type:` Indicates whether the created ref is a branch or a tag.
- `github.event.ref:` The name of the branch or tag that was created (e.g., new-feature-branch or v1.0.0).
- `github.event.pusher.name:` The GitHub username of the person who pushed the new ref.

Essentially, it provides all the data that GitHub sends when an event occurs, allowing your workflow to react to specific details of that event.
